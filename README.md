Customer Profitability Analysis

Project Overview
     This project analyzes customer-level profitability tp identify why high-sales customers still generate losses due to excessive discounting.
Objective

-Identify total number of customers
-Find profitable vs loss-making customers
-Understand how discount levels affect customer profit
-Detect customers with high sales but negative profit
-Provide actionable business recommendations

Dataset

-Sales transaction data containing:
  Customer ID
  Sales
  Discount
  Profit

Key Analysis Performed

1️.Customer Count
  Total unique customers identified
  Clear separation of profitable and loss-making customers
2️. Profit Distribution
  Analyzed overall customer profit distribution
  Identified customers contributing to major losses
3️. Discount vs Customer Profit
  High discounts (especially above 20%–50%) are strongly linked to losses
  Some customers show high sales volume but negative profit due to heavy discounting
4️.Loss-Making Customers
  Top loss-making customers were identified
  These customers require pricing or discount strategy review

Key Insights

-High discounts significantly reduce profitability
-Not all high-sales customers are valuable
-A small group of customers causes a large portion of losses
-Discount strategy must be controlled at customer level, not just product level

Business Recommendations

-Review or restrict customers receiving high discounts with consistent losses
-Implement discount caps for low-margin customers
-Focus retention strategies on profitable customers
-Monitor customer profitability regularly, not just sales volume

Tools & Technologies

-Python
-Pandas
-Matplotlib / Seaborn
-Jupyter Notebook
